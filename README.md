### Job Site Planning 
- Create a model that represents the job
- view handles user submitting form and creating a job posting/listing
- view displays all of the jobs that are available
- updating a job so that it's no longer available and doesn't show on search results/homepage
- users won't be able to "apply" for a position through the website but provide a contact form
- special slot on the site for sponsored job postings
- handle payments for sponsored job postings
